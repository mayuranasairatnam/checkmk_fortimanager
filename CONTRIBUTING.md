# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve the Checkmk FortiManager Plugin. Bug reports,
documentation corrections and focused pull requests are welcome. Follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all project discussions.

## Reporting bugs and suggesting changes

Check existing issues before opening a new one. For a bug report, include:

- The plugin version and the Checkmk and FortiManager versions you use.
- The relevant configuration, including ADOM exclusions, without credentials
  or other sensitive information.
- Steps to reproduce the problem, expected behavior and actual behavior.
- Relevant error messages and a minimal, sanitized response example if needed.

Remove passwords, API tokens, session cookies, serial numbers, internal host
addresses and customer information before sharing logs or API responses.
For substantial changes, open an issue to discuss the intended behavior first.

## Local setup and validation

Fork the repository and create a branch for your change. From the project
directory, use a virtual environment and run the tests and package build:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -B build_mkp.py
```

The offline tests use Checkmk API doubles and mocked device connections.
No external test dependencies or appliance credentials are needed. Offline
tests do not replace installation, discovery and monitoring checks in a real
Checkmk site. See [Tested environments](README.md#tested-environments)
for the maintainer's tested versions.

## Making changes

- Follow the existing Python style and keep changes focused on one problem.
- Keep service names, plugin IDs and exported metrics compatible where possible.
- Preserve valid zero measurements and report missing or invalid data explicitly.
- Keep credentials and raw sensitive responses out of process arguments,
  exceptions, logs and service output.
- Add or update meaningful tests when changing behavior. Documentation-only
  changes normally need no new tests.
- Update the README overview and relevant guides in [docs/](docs/installation.md)
  when configuration, services or behavior change.

Sources live under `cmk_addons_plugins/fortimanager/`. The
`cmk_addons/plugins` symlink supports local imports; edit the source files
rather than replacing the symlink. Generated MKPs and Python caches must not
be committed.

## Pull requests and releases

Open a pull request against `main`. Explain the problem, the resulting behavior
and how you validated it. Include any compatibility impact or checks that you
could not perform. Sanitize all examples and screenshots.

GitHub Actions runs the offline tests and builds the MKP. After changes reach
`main`, CI manages release versions, tags and MKP release assets. Do not create
release tags or change package versions solely for a normal contribution.
